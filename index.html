          <h2>1st single &lt;A thursday kind of love&gt; release on 2025.12.04<time datetime="2025-11-13">2025.11.13</time></h2>
          <p>
          my first song, "A thursday kind of love,” will be released on December 4, 2025 !! it’s a song about warmth, fleeting moments, and the kind of love that feels like coming home after a long time away.<br/><br/>
          as i am starting and sorting out things again, it will be available on bandcamp and youtube only for now. if you’d like to support me directly, the best way is through bandcamp... but i’ll continue finding ways to make my work accessible for everyone who wants to listen.<br/><br/>
          thank you for your patience, kindness, and belief through all my restarts. i’m so grateful you’re here to see it unfold.

          <h2>Introduction<time datetime="2025-11-09">2025.11.09</time></h2>
          <p>
          hello, this is SunnyThursdays.<br/><br/>
          i’ve gone by many names before... each one a reflection of who i was at the time. some were soft and hopeful, some were born from exhaustion; each one a fragment of someone searching for belonging. but somewhere along the way, the spark dimmed. the noise of comparison, the weight of perfection, the burnout that comes from trying too hard to be “enough”... they all caught up to me.<br/><br/>
          and yet, after all the restarts, i still find myself here, looking for beauty in the smallest things, listening for that familiar hum beneath the quiet.<br/><br/>
          SunnyThursdays is the name i chose to carry forward. i was born on a sunny thursday, and it is also a promise to myself to make things gently again. to create not as a mirror of my past, but as a way of moving toward something brighter. it’s not about who i used to be, it’s about what i can still become.<br/><br/>
          so here i am. starting anew. writing songs that feel like morning light after rain. sketching things that might turn into games or stories. breathing life into every little thing that reminds me i’m still here.<br/><br/>
          thank you for finding me, for listening, for helping me remember that even after all the false starts, there’s still a reason to keep creating. i hope it reaches those who feel like they’ve been searching too, and reminds them that it’s okay to try again.
